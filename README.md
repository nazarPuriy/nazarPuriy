Most of the projects have been uploaded recently. This is due to the fact that I had made them some years before, when I didn't know github, or because they are part of private repositories that I can't fork. The main purpose of them is to show some of the projects that I have done. In order to give some index :
- <a href="https://github.com/nazarPuriy/Artificial-Neural-Network">Artificial Neural Network</a>: from scratch (without ml libraries) in order to classify MNIST numbers.
- <a href="https://github.com/nazarPuriy/WorkMeOut">Android Application</a>: android application for a social media focused on sports.
- <a href="https://github.com/nazarPuriy/Sports">WebPage</a>: sports web page where you can log in and buy tickets for matches. This one was deployed on Heroku.
- <a href="https://github.com/nazarPuriy/Wordle">Wordle</a>: client server project in which you can run one server and different clients that connect to the first one in order to play the well known wordle game.
- <a href="https://github.com/nazarPuriy/PAE">Robot</a>: motherboard with sensors and motors that were programmed to follow a wall. This includes a simulation of the robot's world because the project was done at Covid times.

I have done other projects that are not uploaded here, but I can provide them. This include: media players, old-style games, reccomenders (films and series - ml), pacman (reinforcment learning - following Berkeley University project), different artificial vision projects (Scikit-learn), etc.
