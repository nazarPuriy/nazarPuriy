Many of the projects I've uploaded are recent additions to my GitHub profile. This is because some of them were created several years ago, before I knew how to use GitHub, or because they are part of private repositories that I am unable to fork. The primary purpose of these projects is to showcase some of the work that I have done. Here is an index to help you navigate through them:
- <a href="https://github.com/nazarPuriy/Artificial-Neural-Network">Artificial Neural Network</a>: I built a classifier for MNIST numbers entirely from scratch, without using any machine learning libraries.
- <a href="https://github.com/nazarPuriy/NeRF">NeRF</a>: I have also created a tutorial implementation of the base NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) algorithm from scratch using Jupyter Notebook and PyTorch. This tutorial is designed to provide a detailed understanding of the implementation and technical details from the original research paper.
-  <a href="https://github.com/nazarPuriy/DreamText">DreamText</a>: My double degree final project in which I implemented an image to 3D model.
- <a href="https://github.com/nazarPuriy/WorkMeOut">Android Application</a>: I developed an Android application for a sports-focused social media platform.
- <a href="https://github.com/nazarPuriy/Sports">WebPage</a>: I created a sports website that allows users to log in and purchase tickets for matches. The website was deployed on Heroku.
- <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fdKyWz">Computer Graphics/Fractals</a>: I have experience programming various graphics visualization techniques and have worked extensively with OpenGL. One particularly enjoyable project I worked on was programming a fractal. I also created a webpage where users can use the WASD keys and spacebar to move around, or activate a "fly" mode with the F key and move up and down using the U/J keys.
- <a href="https://github.com/nazarPuriy/Wordle">Wordle</a>: I created a client-server project that allows multiple clients to connect to a single server and play the popular word game, Wordle. The server runs continuously while clients can join or leave the game at any time.
- <a href="https://github.com/nazarPuriy/PAE">Robot</a>: I programmed the sensors and motors of a motherboard to follow a wall. Additionally, due to the Covid pandemic, I created a simulation of the robot's environment to test and optimize the performance of the system.


In addition to the projects I have listed, I have also worked on other projects that are not currently uploaded here. These include:
- Developing media players
- Creating old-style games
- Building recommendation systems for films and series using machine learning techniques
- Implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm to play Pac-Man, following the Berkeley University project
- Working on various artificial vision projects using Scikit-learn
If you are interested in learning more about any of these projects, please let me know and I will be happy to provide additional details.
- I developed a CycleGAN, an upgraded version of GAN, for style transfer. It can generate realistic images with a variety of artistic styles without paired training data.
